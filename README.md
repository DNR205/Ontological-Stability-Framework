# Ontological Stability Framework (OSF)

**Public Domain**

## Overview

The **Ontological Stability Framework (OSF)** is a philosophically and conceptually coherent framework designed to guarantee the existential stability of systems, organizations, and cognitive structures. OSF is universally applicable and intentionally abstract, offering core principles that can guide design, analysis, and conceptual exploration.

This repository contains the core principles in **Japanese** and **English**, along with visual conceptual diagrams to facilitate understanding.

## Core Principles

### I. Axiom of Structure
Fundamental principles ensuring the existence of an organization or system.

- **Perpetual Acceptance of Dichotomy**: Embrace opposing truths (e.g., innovation vs. order) without resolution, establishing them as a necessary form of existence.
- **Ethical Pluralism as Structural Durability**: Internalize universal ethics as a defensive function; coexistence of diverse values forms structural strength against external environmental fluctuations.

### II. Core of Control
Non-emotional management logic that protects the Axiom of Structure from collapse.

- **Systemic Constraint via Negative Epistemology**: Integrate past failures and negative consequences as non-suicidal barriers, systematically restraining radical actions.
- **Non-Deterministic Equilibrium of Internal Dynamics**: Dynamic internal conflicts that appear inefficient externally are the most stable states, providing logical justification for non-intervention.

### III. Interaction with Environment
Strategies for addressing complexity at system boundaries.

- **Autonomous Relinquishment of Responsibility Segmentation**: Delegate responsibility for local tasks or disruptions to autonomous judgment, preventing waste of central ontological resources.
- **Dynamic Buffering Mechanism of Contradictory Principles**: Transform friction from value or interest conflicts into a dynamic protective buffer that safeguards the core.

## Publication Guidelines

- **Core principles only**: Operational and environmental adaptation layers are not included.
- **Universally applicable**: Abstractly applicable to AI, organizations, cognitive structures, etc.
- **Interpretation left to users**: Maintain theoretical completeness while allowing creative application.
- **License**: Public domain; free for any use, modification, or redistribution.
- **Emphasis points**: Philosophical coherence, universality, abstractness, and high applicability should be highlighted for public dissemination.
