# OSF â€” Public Concept Document (Core Principles, Public Domain)

**Title**: Ontological Stability Framework (OSF)

**License**: This document and its content are in the **public domain**. Anyone may freely use, modify, and redistribute.

**Purpose**: To publish the core principles of a framework that is philosophically and conceptually coherent, universally applicable to organizations, AI, and cognitive structures.

## 1. Core Principles of the Framework

### **I. Axiom of Structure**

Fundamental principles that guarantee the existence of an organization or system.

| Principle                                      | Definition / Function                                                                                                                                      | Public Emphasis Point                                                    |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Perpetual Acceptance of Dichotomy**          | Embrace opposing truths (e.g., innovation vs. order) without resolution, establishing them as a necessary form of existence.                               | Highlights philosophical and logical coherence; emphasizes universality. |
| **Ethical Pluralism as Structural Durability** | Internalize universal ethics as a defensive function; coexistence of diverse values forms structural strength against external environmental fluctuations. | Emphasizes applicability to organizational and AI resilience design.     |

### **II. Core of Control**

Non-emotional management logic that protects the Axiom of Structure from collapse.

| Principle                                              | Definition / Function                                                                                                                           | Public Emphasis Point                                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Systemic Constraint via Negative Epistemology**      | Integrates past failures and negative consequences as non-suicidal barriers, systematically restraining radical actions.                        | Demonstrates historical learning and risk management concepts.                     |
| **Non-Deterministic Equilibrium of Internal Dynamics** | Dynamic internal conflicts that appear inefficient externally are the most stable states, providing logical justification for non-intervention. | Suggests applications to complex systems, organizational theory, and AI stability. |

### **III. Interaction with Environment**

Strategies for addressing complexity at the boundaries of the organization or system.

| Principle                                                    | Definition / Function                                                                                                                     | Public Emphasis Point                                                                  |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Autonomous Relinquishment of Responsibility Segmentation** | Delegate responsibility for local tasks or disruptions to autonomous judgment on-site, preventing waste of central ontological resources. | Highlights autonomy and distributed management; applicable for conceptual publication. |
| **Dynamic Buffering Mechanism of Contradictory Principles**  | Transform friction from value or interest conflicts into a dynamic protective buffer that safeguards the core.                            | Illustrates stability concepts for complex systems and organizational culture.         |
